A repo with the talks I've given at conferences, etc

## [Swift Summit 2015](http://swiftsummit.com): Back to the Futures
Presentation on the problems with traditional asynchronous, callback-based APIs in Objective-C, `NSError`-based error handling, and how we can do both a lot better in Swift, for example, by implementing a simple `Future` API.

## [RACDC 2015](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/issues/1909): RAC3, A Real World Use Case (aka ReactiveChess)
Overview of how [WatchChess](http://www.watchchessapp.com) was implemented using ReactiveCocoa 3.0, sharing a few tricks that I learned during its development.

## [NSMeetup San Francisco - July 2015](http://www.meetup.com/nsmeetup/events/223263035/): Swift Sync and Async Error Handling
Showing some of the problems with traditional synchronous and asynchronous error handling in Objective-C, and how we can do better in Swift with `Result`, some kind of `Future` API, and comparing it with the new Swift 2 `throws` syntax.
